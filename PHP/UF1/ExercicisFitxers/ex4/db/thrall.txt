Thrall's first encounter with other orcs was while training with Sergeant and several trainees at Durnholde. A cart of captured orcs was moving through Durnholde at the time, to be kept within the camps, and one who saw Thrall believed that rather than it being a training exercise he was being ganged up on by humans. The orc broke free of his chains and moved to save Thrall, yelling at him in Orcish to run away, but at the time, Thrall did not understand any language except Common and so had no idea what his would-be savior was shouting. The orc was beaten and killed right before the young Thrall's eyes.
