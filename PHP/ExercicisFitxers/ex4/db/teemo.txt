Teemo’s lore has changed quite a bit. According to the League of Legends Wiki, he is currently on his fourth iteration of the lore. That’s a true release champion right there.

The first iteration of Teemo is pretty bizarre, and not just because it focuses on the actual in-lore League of Legends. Teemo started as a scout leader in Bandle City. But he wasn’t just responsible for fixing up activities for kiddos, he was also in it for the straight murder that comes with defending his homeland. He also wrote a autobiography that he would apparently sign copies of outside of the League of Legends.
